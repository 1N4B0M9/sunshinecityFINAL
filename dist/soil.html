    <h1>Climate Change Affects our Soil</h1>
    <p>Climate change creates drastic changes in all areas of life, one of those areas is soil.
        After oceans, soil is the second largest natural thing that captures carbon from air so it is vital we protect it. One of the effects climate change does to our soil is it takes moisture from it. This can lead to smaller yields of food and even desertification. Climate change can also mess up plant cycles, also causing plants to produce smaller yields. 
        
        </p>
    <p>One effect found by Washington University students found that increased carbon actually thickens the leaves on trees. At first that sounds like a good thing, but it isnâ€™t. The thickening of leaves will actually decrease the amount of carbon dioxide trees can absorb. That means less oxygen that trees can produce. 

        </p>
        <p>
            With the chance of trees producing less oxygen and plants yielding less fruits, it is imperative to protect our soil.

		The relationship between capitalism and the environment is quite tragic. According to UFM Market Trends “Capitalism is incompatible with the conservation of nature.” With world temperatures rising due to climate change, icebergs melting and greenhouse gasses destroying the ozone layer, this should be an important issue.

		Sustainability is the gold standard for the environment. Sustainability is defined as, “the ability to be maintained at a certain rate or level.” Environmental sustainability is where you don’t leave a negative impact on the earth. Unfortunately, a lot of companies are not environmentally sustainable. Companies mass produce unsustainable products all the time. Look at plastic water bottles, plastic bags, even paper coffee cups are environmentally unsustainable. According to CNBC, “Made almost exclusively from fossil fuels, these "throwaway" plastics often end their short life cycle polluting the oceans, being burned or dumped into landfills.” Keep in my buring these plastics will create more green house gases.

		All of the these unsustainable products are mostly being mass produced in factories. Obviously these factories let off many byproducts like more greenhouse gasses and the runoff industrial farms are creating, polluting our water. Even the power plants that power these factories release a lot of greenhouse gases. According to the Yale School of the Environment “In 2019, 58 percent of the country’s [China] total energy consumption came from coal, which helps explain why China accounts for 28 percent of all global CO2 emissions.”

		Companies need to stop creating products that demolish the environment. The products that end up floating in the ocean, the products that release toxic chemicals when they get made and the products that take hundreds of years to degrade.
